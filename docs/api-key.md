# API Key

Auctioneer and WordPress need a shared API key to communicated securely with each other.

This API key needs to be generated, added to both WordPress and Node via the WP VIP CLI, and then the apps need to be redeployed.

Review the [API Key documentation](https://github.com/Good-Bids/goodbids-node/blob/main/docs/api-key.md) in the `goodbids-node` repo for more information.
